# if bug
# /Users/myriam1/code/myriamdbs/rails-stupid-coaching/db/schema.rb doesn't exist yet. Run `rails db:migrate` to create it, then try again. If you do not intend to use a database, you should instead alter /Users/myriam1/code/myriamdbs/rails-stupid-coaching/config/application.rb to limit the frameworks that will be loaded.
# run rails db:migrate
